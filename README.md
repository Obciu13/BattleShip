# BattleShip

Simple C++ implementation of BattleShip game for 2 people. At the start, you can choose if you want to play in debug mode (you can see all the ships at the start). Positions of ships are random and players in their turn, try to guess where ships of the opponent are. Then they get information if they hit, hit-and-destroy ship, or miss. Game ends when one of the player shoots all of enemies ships.
